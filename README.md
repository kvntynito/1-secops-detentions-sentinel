# <Project Title>

SIEM + Detection Engineering Repo

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detection rules
- Sentinel KQL queries
- Incident investigations
- Logs
- Architecture diagram

## 🧪 What’s Inside
- `docs/` – reports, playbooks, baselines, diagrams
- `scripts/` – Python/PowerShell/Bash utilities
- `lab/` – sample logs, datasets, IaC
- `.github/` – issue/PR templates

## 🏗️ Lab Setup (Quick Start)
- Host: Proxmox/VMWare/Hyper-V/Docker (choose one)
- VMs: Windows Server 2019, Ubuntu 22.04, Kali
- Network: pfSense with two VLANs (Home / Lab)
- Cloud: Azure free tier
  - Microsoft Sentinel
  - Log Analytics Workspace
  - Defender for Cloud
  - Azure AD / Entra ID
You can recreate this with minimal cost using an Azure trial subscription.

## ▶️ How to Run (Testing & Execution)
**1. Generate test events**
- nmap -A <target>
- Failed login attempts
- Suspicious PowerShell scripts
- Sysmon event generation

**2. Load logs into Sentinel**
- Upload Windows Event Logs
- Sysmon logs
- Linux auth logs
- Custom logs

**3. Run detection rules**
- Open Sentinel → Analytics
- Create custom detection
- Paste your KQL rule
- Set severity + tactics (MITRE ATT&CK)
- Save & run

**4. Trigger & investigate incidents**
- Confirm alerts fire
- Open the “Incidents” blade
- Document the investigation in docs/Incident_Report_TEMPLATE.md



## 📊 Deliverables
✅ Detection rules (KQL)
✅ Incident reports documenting triage & findings
✅ Log samples for reproducible testing
✅ Architecture flow diagram showing log ingestion paths
✅ Screenshots of alerts & incident timelines

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Bullet points of concepts/skills you gained - Write what you learned about KQL, log sources, detection logic.
- How SIEMs ingest & normalize logs
- How to identify suspicious patterns in Windows, Linux, and Sysmon logs
- Writing detection logic using KQL (Kusto Query Language)
- Connecting multiple log sources to Sentinel
- Building alerts that align with MITRE ATT&CK
- Investigating alerts & documenting root cause
- Using Azure’s cloud-native SecOps tools in a real environment

## ✅ Next Steps
- Add 10+ new detection rules (brute force, malware, lateral movement)
- Integrate a SOAR (Logic Apps) workflow for automated response
- Add enrichment scripts to correlate IPs with VirusTotal/AbuseIPDB
- Add more sample logs (Apache, Sysmon v13, Windows DNS logs)
- Build a small threat-hunting workbook with custom dashboards
